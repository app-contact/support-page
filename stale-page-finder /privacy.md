# Privacy Policy - Content Health Check

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Introduction

Content Health Check ("the App") is a Confluence Cloud application developed by middlecore. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data.

## Data Collection

### What we collect
- **No personal data is collected or stored.** The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

### What we access
The App accesses the following Confluence data in real-time to provide its functionality:
- Page titles
- Page URLs
- Last modified dates
- Space information
- Page authors (display names only)

This data is accessed only when you perform a search and is not stored or transmitted outside of Atlassian's infrastructure.

## Data Storage

The App does not store any user data. All operations are performed in real-time using Confluence's native APIs.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.

## Security

Content Health Check is built on Atlassian Forge, which runs entirely within Atlassian's secure cloud infrastructure. No data leaves Atlassian's environment.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
