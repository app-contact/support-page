# Privacy Policy - Stale Page Finder

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Introduction

Stale Page Finder ("the App") is a Confluence Cloud application developed by middlecore. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

**No personal data is collected or stored.** The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

### What We Access

The App accesses the following Confluence data in real-time to provide its functionality:

- Page titles
- Page URLs
- Last modified dates
- Space information
- Page authors (display names only)

This data is accessed only when you perform a search and is not stored or transmitted outside of Atlassian's infrastructure.

## Data Storage

The App does not store any user data. All operations are performed in real-time using Confluence's native APIs.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.

## Sub-processors

The App does not use any sub-processors. All processing occurs within Atlassian's Forge infrastructure.

## Security

Stale Page Finder is built on Atlassian Forge, which runs entirely within Atlassian's secure cloud infrastructure. No data leaves Atlassian's environment.

Key security features:
- Backend code (resolvers) executes within Atlassian's serverless infrastructure
- Frontend runs in a sandboxed iframe within your browser
- No external network requests are made
- No data is stored outside of Confluence

## Children's Privacy
