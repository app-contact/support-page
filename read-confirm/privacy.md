# Privacy Policy - Read Confirm

**Last updated: February 2026**

## Introduction

Read Confirm ("the App") is a Confluence Cloud application developed by middlecore. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

The App collects and stores the following data to provide its functionality:

- **Confirmation Request Data**: Request settings, target page IDs, creator information, deadlines, and messages
- **Confirmation Records**: User account IDs, confirmation timestamps, and request associations

### What We Access

The App accesses the following Confluence data:

- User account IDs and display names
- Group memberships (for group-based targeting)
- Page titles and IDs
- Space information

## Data Storage

All data is stored using Atlassian Forge Storage, which is hosted entirely within Atlassian's secure infrastructure. Data stored includes:

- Confirmation requests created by administrators
- Individual confirmation records (who confirmed and when)
- Request metadata (deadlines, messages, target settings)

**Data Retention**: Data is retained as long as the associated confirmation request exists. When a request is deleted, all associated confirmation records are also deleted.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties. All data remains within Atlassian's infrastructure.

## Sub-processors

The App does not use any sub-processors. All processing occurs within Atlassian's Forge infrastructure.

## Security

Read Confirm is built on Atlassian Forge, which runs entirely within Atlassian's secure cloud infrastructure. No data leaves Atlassian's environment.

Key security features:
- Backend code (resolvers) executes within Atlassian's serverless infrastructure
- Frontend runs in a sandboxed iframe within your browser
- No external network requests are made
- All data stored within Atlassian Forge Storage
- Access controls ensure only authorized users can view confirmation data

## GDPR Compliance

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA):

- **Legal Basis**: Processing is based on legitimate interest to provide confirmation tracking functionality
- **Data Minimization**: We only collect data necessary for the confirmation workflow
- **No External Transfer**: No data is transferred outside of Atlassian's infrastructure
- **Right to Access**: Users can view their own confirmation status through the App
- **Right to Deletion**: Administrators can delete confirmation requests, which removes all associated data
- **Right to Information**: You may contact us at contact@middle-core.com for any privacy-related inquiries
